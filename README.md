Hello!

I am Neehal. I am always doing something, right now im doing btech in CS from IIT Palakkad. I am also/always actively learning techniques and the intricacies of c++ to quenchy my thist of problem solving. I try my hand at problem solving on multiple competitive programming websites. i have always loved the concept of ai and letting a piece of code think for us and make our decisions, which lead me to solve the US Beerkley's AI pacman project. and i have tried to step up the game by trying to let the code take real world input and make decisions, differentiate... ie. play in the field of image recognition. 

Apart from coding my favourite activities are painting and sketching. My artistic endeavour lead me to learn css and html( I feel css in itself is a paint brush and html is my paint set!... the imagination is the only limit) to build a website to showcase my art work. Which has been in the making for quite some time now, but there there I will pick my brush and paints up again and finish the task soon!

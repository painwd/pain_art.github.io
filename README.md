Apart from coding my favourite activities are painting and sketching. My artistic endeavour lead me to learn css and html( I feel css in itself is a paint brush and html is my paint set!... the imagination is the only limit) to build a website to showcase my art work. Which has been in the making for quite some time now, but there there I will pick my brush and paints up again and finish the task soon!
